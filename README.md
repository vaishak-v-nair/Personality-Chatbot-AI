# 🧠 Personality Chatbot AI (MBTI-Based)

An AI-powered personality-aware chatbot that detects a user's **MBTI personality type** from text and dynamically adapts its responses to match that personality.

Built to explore the intersection of **NLP, personality modeling, and adaptive conversational AI**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project analyzes user input to infer their **MBTI personality type** and generates responses aligned with their psychological traits.  
Instead of a generic chatbot, responses are **tailored to how different personality types think, feel, and communicate**.

Key idea:
> *Same question. Different personality. Different response.*
